### Committing Changes
Changes to the repo will show up in the "Changes" tab of the "GitHub Panel". Select the change you'd like to push to the repo, write a brief Commit Summary and Description, commit, and then push.

### Branch Setup
Work should be done in specific branches organized by `Feature`, `Improvement`, and `Bug`, like this: `Feature/NewFeature`
When a branch is ready for review, merge into the development branch. After testing is completed in `Development`, create a pull request to merge into `Master`.
